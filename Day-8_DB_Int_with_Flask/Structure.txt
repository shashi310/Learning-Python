Please note that this structure provides a starting point and can be further customized based on your specific project needs. As you progress, you'll be creating files and folders for specific functionalities like CRUD operations, order handling, data validation, etc


-----------------------ROADMAP--------------------
Task 1: Database Integration
Directory: app/
Task 1.1: Create a file named models.py in the app/ directory. This file will be responsible for defining data models for menus and orders using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
Task 2: Menu Management
Directory: app/
Task 2.1: In models.py, define the data model for menu items (e.g., item ID, name, description, price, availability).

Task 2.2: Create a file named routes.py in the app/ directory. This file will be responsible for defining routes and views related to menu management.

Task 2.3: In routes.py, implement routes and functions for CRUD operations for menu items (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Task 2.4: Create a directory named templates/ inside the app/ directory. Inside templates/, create HTML templates for managing the menu (e.g., menu.html).

Task 3: Order Handling
Directory: app/
Task 3.1: In models.py, define the data model for orders (e.g., order ID, customer name, item IDs, status).

Task 3.2: In routes.py, implement routes and functions for handling food orders (e.g., accepting new orders, updating order statuses, retrieving orders).

Task 3.3: Create additional templates in the templates/ directory for order handling (e.g., orders.html, new_order.html).

Task 4: Data Validation and Error Handling
Directory: app/
Task 4.1: Implement data validation checks in the routes and functions to ensure that menu items and orders are created and updated with valid attributes.

Task 4.2: Implement error handling to gracefully handle unexpected user input and edge cases in the routes and functions.

Task 5: Documentation
Directory: . (root directory)
Task 5.1: Create a file named README.md in the root directory. In this file, provide instructions for setting up the database, using API endpoints, and interacting with the application.
Task 6: Testing (Optional but highly recommended)
Directory: tests/
Task 6.1: Create a file named test_routes.py in the tests/ directory. In this file, write test cases to ensure the functionality of your routes.
Task 7: Static Files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
Directory: static/
Task 7.1: Add CSS files in the static/css/ directory to style your application. You can name the CSS file as style.css.

Task 7.2: Add JavaScript files in the static/js/ directory for client-side interactions. You can name the JavaScript file as script.js.

Task 7.3: Add any images you plan to use in the static/img/ directory.
