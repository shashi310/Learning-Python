# What is Python?

# Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
# How do you print "Hello, World!" in Python?

# python
# Copy code
# print("Hello, World!")
# What are the different data types in Python?

# Some common data types in Python include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
# What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?

# Explain the difference between == and is in Python.

# == checks for equality in values, while is checks for equality in identity (i.e., they refer to the same object).
# How do you comment out multiple lines of code in Python?

# You can use triple quotes (''' or """) to comment out multiple lines of code.
# What is a function in Python?

# A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It takes input, processes it, and returns an output.
# How do you define a function in Python?

# python
# Copy code
# def my_function(argument1, argument2):
#     # code here
#     return result
# What is a module in Python?

# A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py.
# Explain the concept of a loop in Python.

# A loop in Python allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code. Common types of loops include for and while loops.
# What is the purpose of the if statement in Python?

# The if statement allows you to conditionally execute a block of code based on a specified condition.
# How do you open and read a file in Python?

# python
# Copy code
# with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
#     content = file.read()
# What is a dictionary in Python?

# A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and used to access its corresponding value.
# How do you add a key-value pair to an existing dictionary?

# python
# Copy code
# my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
# my_dict['key3'] = 'value3'
# Explain the concept of exception handling in Python.

# Exception handling in Python involves handling errors that occur during program execution using try, except, and finally blocks.
