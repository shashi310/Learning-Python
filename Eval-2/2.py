# You are given a list of employees and a list of projects, along with their skill requirements. Each employee has a set of skills denoted as a list of strings. Your goal is to create a function named allocate_projects that efficiently assigns projects to employees based on their skills while maximizing the utilization of available skills.

# The function should take two arguments: employees and projects, where:

# 1. employees is a list of dictionaries, each representing an employee's details like name, skills, and current project (initially set to None).

# 2. projects is a list of dictionaries, each representing a project's details including its name and required skills.

# The function should allocate a project to each employee such that the total number of utilized skills across all projects is maximized. An employee can only be assigned to one project, and a project can only be assigned to one employee. An employee can only be assigned a project if they possess all the required skills for that project.

# The function should return a list of dictionaries, each indicating the assignment of a project to an employee. Each dictionary should have the keys "employee" and "project" where the values are the names of the employee and project respectively.
