#Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and calculates their sum.

x = input("Enter the first number: ")
y = input("Enter the second number: ")

# Convert the input strings to integers
x = int(x)
y = int(y)

# Perform numerical addition
result = x + y

# Print the result
print("The sum is:", result)
